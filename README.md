Johannes is a Code Generation Framework based on Java.

# Main concept terms
## Metadata classes
A metadata class contains information about a concret java class about its package, classname, methods, annotations etc.
The information is stored as constants and can be pointed to in the descriptors
## Descriptor classes
A descriptor class describes a single code generation from a source class to a target class. The classes are not directly referenced but by its metadata classes. This makes it possible to point to a field, a method, an annotation and so on, e.g. to mark a field as ignored.
Furthermore, by using a metadata class, the underlying class that is described by the metadata class can be removed, e.g. when this class itself is generated by the framework.

## Generator classes
This classes receives a descriptor class and generate a new source file as described in the descriptor class.
The idea is to have a generator class for each template, like a DAO, a DAO-Test, a Model, ...

# Process
The process of the code generation of this framework is as follow:
1. Create (or generate) a metadata class for a certain java class.
2. Create a generator that describe the template of the output file.
3. Create a descriptor that describe the links between source class and target output and used generator.
4. Generate the class.
